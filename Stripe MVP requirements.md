# **Product Requirements Document: Stripe Payment API (MVP)**

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for an API designed to handle product management and payment processing using the Stripe platform. The primary goal is to provide a backend service that encapsulates all interactions with the Stripe API, adhering to Clean Architecture principles for maintainability, testability, and future scalability.

## **2\. Project Goals**

The main objectives for this API's Minimum Viable Product (MVP) are:

* **Secure Payment Processing:** Successfully process payments for digital or physical products using Stripe's test environment.  
* **Product Management:** Provide a simple mechanism to create and manage products within the API's scope.  
* **Architectural Foundation:** Implement the API using Clean Architecture to ensure separation of concerns and a clear, logical structure for future feature expansion.

## **3\. Scope (MVP)**

The initial scope of this project is limited to the core functionalities required to demonstrate a complete payment flow in a test environment.

### **3.1. In-Scope**

* **Product Creation:** An endpoint to create a product entity on the Stripe platform.  
* **Payment Intent Creation:** An endpoint to create a Stripe PaymentIntent for a specific product.  
* **Payment Confirmation:** A mechanism to receive and handle payment confirmation from the frontend client.  
* **Payment Status Retrieval:** An endpoint to check the status of a specific payment.  
* Integration with the Stripe API using the official .NET SDK.  
* All API functionality will operate within Stripe's "test mode."

### **3.2. Out-of-Scope (for MVP)**

* Webhook handling for asynchronous events.  
* Subscription-based payments.  
* Handling of refunds or chargebacks.  
* Complex tax calculations or shipping logistics.  
* Authentication and Authorization (this will be handled by the consuming application, but the API will enforce its own secure access).

## **4\. Functional Requirements**

### **4.1. Product Management**

* **User Story:** As an API user (e.g., a frontend developer), I want to be able to create a new product so that it can be offered for sale.  
  * **Requirement:** The API must expose a POST /products endpoint that accepts a JSON payload containing product details (e.g., name, price, description).  
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * A new product is successfully created in Stripe.  
    * The API returns the product ID and confirmation of creation.

### **4.2. Payment Processing**

* **User Story:** As an API user, I want to initiate a payment for a specific product so that I can securely complete the transaction on the frontend.  
  * **Requirement:** The API must expose a POST /payments/create endpoint that accepts a product ID.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * The API creates a Stripe PaymentIntent for the specified product.  
    * The API returns the client\_secret from the PaymentIntent to the frontend, which will be used to confirm the payment.

### **4.3. Payment Status**

* **User Story:** As an API user, I want to be able to check the status of a completed payment so that I can confirm the transaction's success.  
  * **Requirement:** The API must expose a GET /payments/{id} endpoint where {id} is the Stripe PaymentIntent ID.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * The API returns the current status of the payment intent (e.g., succeeded, requires\_payment\_method).

## **5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Architecture:** The API will be developed using Clean Architecture principles, separating the application into distinct layers:  
  * **Domain:** Contains the core business entities (e.g., Product, Payment).  
  * **Application:** Manages business logic and use cases.  
  * **Infrastructure:** Handles external dependencies, including the Stripe SDK, database access, and API configuration.  
  * **Presentation:** The ASP.NET Core API layer that exposes the endpoints.  
* **Technology Stack:**  
  * .NET 8  
  * ASP.NET Core  
  * Stripe .NET SDK  
* **Security:**  
  * The API will not handle or store raw card information. All sensitive data will be handled by the Stripe SDK's secure methods.  
  * API keys will be stored securely (e.g., in appsettings.json or environment variables) and not hardcoded.  
* **Documentation:**  
  * The API endpoints will be documented using Swagger/OpenAPI to facilitate easy integration by frontend developers.  
* **Error Handling:**  
  * The API must provide clear and descriptive error messages for invalid requests or failures from the Stripe API.

## **6\. High-Level Technical Design**

The Clean Architecture approach will ensure that our core business logic remains independent of the Stripe SDK.

* The **Infrastructure** layer will contain the concrete implementation of a Stripe payment service, which will call the Stripe SDK.  
* The **Application** layer will define an interface (e.g., IPaymentService) that the Infrastructure layer implements. It will contain the CreatePaymentIntentCommand and CreateProductCommand handlers.  
* The **Presentation** layer will expose the RESTful endpoints, calling the appropriate commands from the Application layer.  
* This separation allows us to easily swap out the Stripe implementation in the future if needed, without affecting the core business logic.
